        <p>On the last night of his life he heard a noise like a giant crushing a forest beneath his feet, and smelled a stench like the giant's fart, and he realized that the tree was burning. He got out of his chair and staggered dizzily down to the garden to watch the fire, whose flames were consuming histories, memories, genealogies, purifying the earth, and coming towards him to set him free;<br><span class="dash">-- because the wind was blowing the fire towards the grounds of the mansion, so soon enough, soon enough, it would be his turn.</span></p>

      <div id="column2" class="section">
        <p>He saw the tree explode into a thousand fragments, and the trunk crack, like a heart; then he turned away and reeled towards the place in the garden where Ayesha had first caught his eye;<br><span class="dash">-- and now he felt a slowness come upon him, a great heaviness, and he lay down on the withered dust.</span></p>

      <div id="column3" class="section">
        <p>Before his eyes closed he felt something brushing at his lips, and saw the little cluster of butterflies struggling to enter his mouth. Then the sea poured over him, and he was in the water beside Ayesha, who had stepped miraculously out of his wife's body ... <span class="dialogue">"Open,"</span> she was crying. <span class="dialogue">"Open wide!"</span> Tentacles of light were flowing from her navel and he chopped at them, chopped, using the side of his hand. <span class="dialogue">"Open,"</span> she screamed. <span class="dialogue">"You've come this far, now do the rest."</span><br><span class="dash">-- How could he hear her voice?</span><br><span class="dash">-- They were under water, lost in the roaring of the sea, but he could hear her clearly, they could all hear her, that voice like a bell.</span><br><span class="dialogue">"Open,"</span> she said. He closed.</p>
